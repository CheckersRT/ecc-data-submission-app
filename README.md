This is an app to help music teachers in the UK submit information on the sheet music they are using in the classroom. The aim of the app is to make it as easy as possible for teachers to submit the required sheetmusic data. It uses Google Vision to extract the text from uploaded photos of sheetmusic, and  OpenAi to assume the data from the extracted text. See https://www.everycopycounts.co.uk for more about the programme.
